### Flattening the curve ? Infection is peaking ? Have you wondered what that actually means ? 
This notebook is an attempt to simplify and help understand how to model a pandemic using S.I.R Model(Suseptible,Infected,Recovered).The predicted statistics from the notebook maybe inaccurate with real life observations but the intention of this notebook is to convey how avaiable data can be used for the purpose.


### If you do not wish to download and run this notebook but want to view the results you can find the SIR curve plots [here](https://pythonista7.github.io/plot) and the geo-plot of Bengaluru map [here](https://pythonista7.github.io/kepler_infection_map) (be sure to view the last few cells of this notebook to use the kepler map for visualization.)

This notebook comprises of the 3 main parts:
  1. Data clean-up and extrapolation
  2. SIR Model
  3. Plotting using KeplerGL
